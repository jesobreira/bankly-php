# Bankly (Acesso)

Unnofficial PHP class to access [Bankly](http://bankly.com.br/) (by [Acesso](https://www.meuacesso.com.br/)) API.

[API Docs here.](https://bankly.readme.io/)

[Javascript port here.](https://github.com/jesobreira/bankly-js)

## Usage

Authentication and token refreshing is handled by the class itself.

Start by including the class and creating an instance supplying your client_id and client_secret provided by Acesso.

```php
require_once 'bankly.php';
```

```php
$bankly = new Bankly('client_id', 'client_secret');
```

### Getting account balance

Provide the branch and account number (without hyphen) to get the balance.

```php
$bankly->getBalance('0001', '1234');
```

This method returns [a JSON object](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#accountbalance).

### Getting account statement

Provide:

* Branch (string)
* Account number (string)
* Offset (number, starts at 0)
* Limit (number, `> 0`)
* Details (optional, boolean, default true)
* DetailsLevelBasic (optional, boolean, default true)

```php
$bankly->getStatement('0001', '1234', 0, 10);
```

This method returns [a JSON object](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#accountstatement).

### Getting account events

Provide:

* Branch (string)
* Account number (string)
* Page (number, starts at 1)
* Pagesize (number, `> 0`)
* IncludeDetails (optional, boolean, default true)

```php
$bankly->getEvents('0001', '1234', 1, 10);
```

This method returns [a JSON object](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#events).

### Performing transfers

**Note**: this method causes subtraction of real money.

In order to specify an origin and destination bank account, you must create two BankAccount objects. 

A bank account instance must be created receiving an object with the following properties:

* **branch** (string): account branch
* **account** (string): account number (no hyphen)
* **document** (string): account holder's CPF or CNPJ (numbers only)
* **name** (string): account holder name
* **bankCode** (string, optional): bank code (see below, defaults to Acesso's 332)

Then you will use the `transfer()` method to perform the actual transfer, providing:

* The amount in *centavos* (1 BRL = 100 centavos)
* Reference or description (human-readable string)
* Sender (a BankAccount object)
* Recipient (a BankAccount Object)

Example:

```php
$from = new BankAccount;
$from->branch = '0001';
$from->account = '1234';
$from->document = '00000000000000';
$from->name = 'Company LTDA';

$to = new BankAccount;
$to->bankCode = '123';
$to->branch = '1234';
$to->account = '12345';
$to->document = '00000000000';
$to->name = 'John Doe';

// transfer BRL 5 (R$ 5)
$bankly->transfer(500, 'test', $from, $to);
```

This method returns [an object](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#testinput). This object contains an "authenticationCode" property with a string, with a reference code for the transaction that you will use to check its status later.

### Getting transfer status

Use the following method to retrieve a transaction's status. You will need to provide:

* The origin branch
* The origin account number
* The AuthenticationId (that you receive as `authenticationCode` from the `transfer` method)

```php
$bankly->getTransferStatus('0001', '1234', 'AuthenticationId');
```

This method returns [a JSON object](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#testinput-1).

### Getting banks list

You can get a list of banks and payment institutions with respective codes from the Central Bank (Bacen). No authentication is needed. You can either call this getter from your instance:

```php
$banks = bankly->bankList;
```

Or use this static method directly (no class instancing needed):

```php
$banks = Bankly::bankList();
```

This returns [a JSON array](https://bankly.readme.io/reference#banklist). You can also perform this request using your browser by [clicking here](https://api.bankly.com.br/baas/banklist).

### Debugging

You can define a function that receives debug logs (as strings) from your instance of the class.

```php
$bankly.debug = function ($msg) {
	echo $msg . "\r\n";
};
```
